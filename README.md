# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Machine

 This project developed for my image processing course during my education in MS of software engineering at Shahid Beheshti University. This system is an implementation of my paper that provides a survey about people that transfer by subway transportation and their mental situation when they go to the work or coming back and on the way of their home. With the help of a camera that installed at the entrance of subways, the people images captured by this camera. Thereafter, these images analyzed by the software and with facial features such as the curve of the eyebrow, state of the nose, leap, eyes that calculated by mathematical algorithms, the software could detect the individuals are happy, sad, and etc. The data are saved into the database and the results could be depicted by diagrams.
